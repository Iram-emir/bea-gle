            The <i><b>Beagle</b></i> is a breed of small scent hound, similar in appearance to
            the much larger foxhound. The <i><b>beagle</b></i> was developed primarily for
            hunting hare, known as beagling. Possessing a great sense of smell
            and superior tracking instincts, the <i><b>beagle</b></i> is the primary breed
            used as a detection dog for prohibited agricultural imports and
            foodstuffs in quarantine around the world. The beagle is a popular
            pet due to its size, good temper, and a lack of inherited health
            problems.
